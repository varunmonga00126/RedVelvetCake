**How to Make red velvet Cake step by step...........**


step 1 . First preheat your over to 350 F(176 C).Next let's make our cake better. Start by cake batter.Start  by creaming your butter and your white granulated or caster sugar together in a large bowl . Use  a hand mixer or stand mixer to do this. 

step2. Now we add in our eggs one at a time. So drop one egg in,mix,once that egg is completely incorporateddo the other eggs.Make sure toscrape the sides of the bowl nas well with a spatula.

step 3. Now we add in ousr cocoa powder. It is a good idea to run  it through some kind of a sifter. Cocoa powder tends to get a bit lumpy.Then mix again and scrapethe sides as needed Throughout this whole  process we do not want to over mix ,just until things are incorporated.Ifwe mix too much we will add too much air into the batter which can causenair pockets in our cake .

step 4. Now add in your vanilla extract to your curd as well as your white vinegar .If you do not have curd you can make some bny taking just shy of one cup of regular milk and adding one tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar add then let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes . Stir in the vinegar and vanillan extract until combined.

step 5. Now we add in our oil to the curd mixture. Next add in about 2 to 2 and 1/2 tablespoons of red food coloring liquid. Then stir, until the mixture is a nice red color. Set that mixture aside for now .

step 6. Next we will add our salt and baking soda to our flour. You can use cake flour or all - purpose flour tends to work alittle bit better , but all-purpose work gret too .Use a whisk to combine those ingredients.

step 7. Next we will add in about half of our food coloring curd mixture and about half of our flour mixture ,then ture on the mixture and mix until just combined .Give the sides of the bowl a good scrape  then complete the process until all the ingredients have been mixed leaving you with a nice red velvet  cake batter.

step 8 . Now wew just  fill up two 9 inch or 8 inch  cake  pans  with equal amounts of cake batter . Make sure to use shortening or kitcher spray on the pans and my nonstick pans are great , but I  like   to over - do it . LOl Also it is a good idea to lightly tap the pans with the batter in it, this will allow any cake bubbles to rise to the top , which helps to   prevent air pockets , but sometime  it is unavoidable and you just get them,a combination of over mixing ,etc  . But it won't effect the taste of the cake at all !so do not worry about it . I never do . Lol   now  bake  those cakes for 23 to 30  minutes untill when a toothpick comes out clean after poking it in the middle.

step 9 .Now after the cakes come out of the over let's leave them alone  and allow them to cool in their pans for about 10 minutes. After that  we can remove them from their pans, remove the parchment paper and then let the cakes cool completely onthe rack.Afterwards you can place the cakes in the fridge and let them chill ,which helps with the frosting ,or just go onto the the the frosting step noe, it's totally up to you!

step 10 . Well now it is  time to make our frosting ,we will be using just a few ingredients,cream cheese,butter, vanilla extract, and of course powdered sugar (confectioner's sugar).

step 11 . Now combine the cream cheese, butter and vanilla extract into a large bowl and mix with a hand mixer untill nice and smooth usually takes a few minutes.Then slowlyincorporate all of the powdered sugar .You may need more or less depending on the consistency that you want .Next just remove the beaters . Frosting is ready to  go. At this  point if the frosting is still too runny  add  more  powdered sugar , or just chill it for about 30 minutes before frosting that cake .

step 12 .  Frist we will trip the cake so it will be somewhat level. You can skip this step if you like .I just  always use my bread knife to cut  the top of  the top layer off as well , the end product will look the top layer of cake on . Then cover that whole cake  with frosting. There are a variety of tools that you  can use , i normally just  use my cake spatula .once done put the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes .This is optional , but  i like to do  it , allows the frosting to set a bit 

step 13 . Now I want to make a heart - shaped cake topper . To dothat I take  my heart cookie cutter and cut out a shape from  the  middle of that piece of cake that i have .Then just place it on top  of the cake .Looks pretty neat right ?

*step 14. Now take the reat of your leftTovet cake and crumble it up with your fingers . Then gently apply it do your cake sides or on top or  skip this step .it is totally up to you how  you decorate your cake.:) Use a piping bag pipe forsting around the top of your heart if you  like .You are done ! now place the cake in the fridge for about  2 hours  before serving. *

Enjoy the Cake   !
